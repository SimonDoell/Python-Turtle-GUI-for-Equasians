I uploaded a GUI for drawing lines, circles and exponential equations with the help of the turtle module. As this is my first upload, please comment on what to change and how to make it more efficient.
If you run the programm, the shell will open and the turtle canvas. You can type in the shell to draw things on the GUI. How you do it is pretty self-explanetory, just do the commands that are shown in the
command prompt and then type a few attributes. You can experiment with this, copy sections of the code etc.
